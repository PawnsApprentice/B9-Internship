# Bit9-Internship Question 1
Question 1 dealing with fibonacci sequence based on arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/)

An attempt was made for the main() function to be as close as possible to the example provided in the internship document as shown in Figure.1

Therefore, the arguments for the makeFunc function pointer were set as (Void*, Void*)
## Development Environement 
The source code was written in C on Windows 11 using the popular MinGW compiler and CodeBlocks. 

Clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of ask1. Enter the command "mingw32-make" similar to the make command on Linux to compile the code and create an executable at the root of the folder.

You can then run the executable on the console to get the output by typing fib.exe.
