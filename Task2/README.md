# Bit9-Internship Question 2
Question 1 dealing with solving the piecewise recurrence relation **F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n -2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2**

The three approaches used were Recursive, Iterative, and Dynamic Programming. With DP and Iterative having the same time and space complexity of O(n) and O(1) while recursive have the worse time complexity of (2^n) and space complexity of O(n)
## Development Environement 
The source code was written in C on Windows 11 using the popular MinGW compiler and CodeBlocks. 

Clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of Task2. Enter the command "mingw32-make" similar to the make command on Linux to compile the code and create an executable at the root of the folder.

You can then run the executable on the console to get the output by typing recur.exe.
