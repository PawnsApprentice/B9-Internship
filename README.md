# Bit9-Internship Tasks
Question 1 and Question 2 were attempted from the coding test and are contained within the Task1 and Task2 folders respectively. 
## Development Environement 
The source code was written in C on Windows 11 using the popular MinGW compiler. 

Clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of either the Task1 or Task2 folder. Enter the command "mingw32-make" similar to the make command on Linux to compile the code and create an executable at the root of the folder.

You can then run the executable on the console to get the output. Task1 will create a fib.exe executable and Task2 will create a recur.exe executable which can be run by simply entering fib.exe. or recur.exe in the terminal.
